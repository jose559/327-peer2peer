Our experiences:

The most complicated part to wrap our heads around in this assignment was the communication over the local network. 
When we first began, the first thing we attempted to tackle was the arp table and the socket/port setup, 
however due to a complication with ethernet vs wifi networks how they affect viewable connections on the arp table 
we werenâ€™t able to actually test whether the connection worked. After some work was done to make sure both 
local systems were on the same network, we were able to figure out the rest of the connection and its subtleties. 
While that part was probably the hardest to figure out, we did run into some problems in the file sharing and 
sending portion. We learned that due to the asynchronous nature of the threads, the timing of the receiving and 
updating could sometimes create problems. We also ran into some problems with the reading of certain files, 
and learned that we needed to encode files in certain ways so that we could send them.
